# EDGE-Transport

EDGE-T is a fork of the [GCAM transport module](https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/energy.html#transportation) with a high level of detail in its representation
of technological and modal options. It is a partial equilibrium model with a nested multinomial logit
structure and relies on the modified logit formulation.
